# Fingerprint-Thinning-using-VHDL

This project is focused on developing a simple and fast fingerprint image-thinning algorithm so it can be implemented on embedded environment using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices. This algorithm will be applied on pixel representation value '0'. For testing and performance evaluation, database of fingerprint from Fingerprint Verification Competition 2004 will be used. The thinning algorithm will be developed and simulated using C++ programming, as well as VHDL for the deployment into FPGA devices.
